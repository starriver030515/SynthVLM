## Quick Usage

## Data Preparation

Prepare your captions in JSON format. Hereâ€™s an example of how your JSON should look:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "caption": "The bus in the image is white and red. The back of the bus features an advertisement. The bus is driving down the street, which is crowded with people and other vehicles."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "caption": "The dog in the image is brown with a red collar. It sits behind a window, looking out longingly, which gives it a sense of longing for the outdoors or something it sees."
    },
]
```

## Data Generation Instructions

To generate images, run the `run.sh` script. The settings can be adjusted as follows:

- **Resolution**: Default is set to 1024x1024 pixels. Modify `width` and `height` in the script to customize.
- **Repetitions**: By default, each caption generates one image. Adjust the `repeat` parameter to increase the number of images per caption, selecting the best quality image for each.

### Model Selection

The process supports two diffusion models:

- **Stable Diffusion 3**: Default model, optimized for a balance between speed and quality.
- **Stable Diffusion XL**: Use this model for faster image generation.
